If you’re anything like I was before I started working at IMPACT, you probably don’t know much about HTML, CSS,
 coding, or development of websites.

Maybe you know a couple coding elements, but have been wanting to learn some more, or perhaps,
 you don't even know that HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. (Did you?) 

Fortunately, my past two and a half years here have made me into a something of a coding...amateur 
(I can’t say "expert" because let’s be real; I can’t build a website or
 anything).

Basic HTML has become an acquired skill of mine, mostly due to the fact that I’m using HubSpot every day,
 but one of the biggest reasons I learned some of these codes is because I was tired of asking my developers
  the simplest questions — and I’m pretty sure they were tired of me, too.

If you find yourself in the same boat as me, publishing blogs, managing websites, and more, hopefully,
 the following basic HTML codes can help make your day a little bit easier.
